# wasm2j

A WebAssembly to Java bytecode compiler.

Should support almost all of WebAssembly 2.0, but it might not work perfectly.

JavaDocs can be found [here](https://eutro.github.io/wasm2j/index.html).

Uses [jwasm](https://github.com/eutro/jwasm), so you'll have to pull
that in somehow if you want to use this.
